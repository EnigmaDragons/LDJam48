Thoughts on underwater section

scientist: you are lab assistant

try this test serum
I noticed orange is one of the ingredients and unfortunately I'm deathly allergic


make a test batch
I'm afraid I dont know the ingredients
this mixing machine appears to be broken 


why do you have that suit
well your last assistant suffered a tragic accident so i figured it must have been his lab coat that did it.
in addition to science i graduated with a business major 


venix: you are personal assistant
why did the alarm go off earlier as if someone was sneaking in


henchman:

whats your job here in the armory section

mechanic, the door was jammed


henchman + scientist:


venix + scientist:

henchman + venix:
