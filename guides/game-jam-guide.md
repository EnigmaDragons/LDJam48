# Game Jam Guide

At Enigma Dragons, we've been jamming with many different teams for 4 years. Here are the key things we want the team to keep in mind.

----

### Your Personal Goals

1. Have fun!
2. Challenge yourself and expand your skills
3. Create something cool that you can showcase for years
4. Don't burn yourself out

If you accomplish this, then you succeeded at the jam, regardless of how people rate the actual game.

### Our Team Goals

1. Create something fun to play
2. Create a complete (though small) experience
3. Ship a game with a good amount of polish

----

### How Do We Achieve That?

1. Keep a small scope!
2. Try to fit as many creation iterations as possible (milestones)
3. Take breaks, exercise, eat, get sunshine, get solid sleep
4. Save time at the end for polish
